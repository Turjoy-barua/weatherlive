1. historical data needs to be fixed for all the fucntions
2. for grapics we're gonna use streamlit which will use a web interface or gonna keep on terminal
   
High‑impact features to make it beautiful and interesting
Colorful terminal UI
Use rich to add colored headers, progress spinners, and tables. Replace print blocks in main.py and history().
Favorites and quick access
Let users save favorite cities and set a default. Add favorites table in database.py, menu option to add/list/select.
7‑day and hourly forecast
Add a forecast menu: next 7 days and next 24 hours with min/max, rain chance. Use Open‑Meteo daily/hourly or OpenWeather forecast endpoints. Plot with visual.plot_trend.
Alerts and notifications
“Rain today?” / “Will it be >30°C tomorrow?” thresholds. Provide alerts command; optionally schedule checks with schedule library.
Compare cities
Side‑by‑side current weather and 7‑day trends for two cities; plot both lines on one chart in visual.py.
Comfort indices
Compute and display Heat Index, Wind Chill, Humidex, and a simple “feels category” (cold, pleasant, hot). Store computed fields to weather table.
Sunrise/Sunset, UV, AQI
Add a more command to show sunrise/sunset, UV index (OpenWeather uvi), and AQI (OpenWeather Air Pollution API).
Trends and statistics
Summaries for a date range: averages, extremes, total rain, streaks (e.g., “3 rainy days in a row”). Add stats command using historical.historical_data(...).
Export & share
export command to save history or trends to CSV/JSON. Handy for school reports. Save under ./exports/.
CLI flags for scripting
Support python main.py current --city "Paris" and --units imperial. Use argparse to bypass interactive prompts.
Localization & units
Per‑user preferences: °C/°F, m/s vs km/h, language/timezone. Store in a settings table; apply in all print functions.
Offline cache & dedup
You already use requests_cache. Extend DB with UNIQUE(date, city) (done above) and add a --offline mode to serve last data when API is down.
Better graphs
Add moving averages and trendlines; annotate max/min points. Provide --save-plot path.png.
Historical comparisons
“Same day last year” and “This month vs last month” from Open‑Meteo daily data. Small insights users love.
Geolocation convenience
Detect city by IP on start (e.g., ipinfo.io) and offer as default.
Error‑proof inputs
Validate dates; fuzzy city match; show suggestions if city not found.
Simple TUI
Optional: use textual for a panel‑based TUI with tabs: Current | Forecast | History | Charts.
README polish
Add screenshots/gifs of terminal output and graphs; clear setup with env var instructions.
Tiny example: make history() pretty with Rich  


What to build first (highest impact)
Colorful UI + pretty tables in current_weather() and history().
7‑day forecast + plots using historical.historical_data via visual.plot_trend(city, start, end, metric).
Alerts (rain/heat) with simple thresholds.
Favorites + default city and export to CSV.
Compare cities plot.
